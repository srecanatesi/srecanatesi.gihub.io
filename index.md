I am a theoretical neuroscientist and machine learning researcher working at the interface between biologial and artificial neural computations. My research works at the intersection of AI and Neuroscience, developing tools to better understand neural networks dynamics as well as algorithms verify similarities in the way biological and artificial neural networks store information. My work is motivated by the remarkable ability of neural networks (biological and artificial) to learn and support complex, emergent computations. I use tools from dynamical systems, information theory, statistics and machine learning to adress a range of problems, in collaboration with experimental neuroscientists and machine intelligence researchers.


The end goal of my research is to extract mechanisms from neural data and ground them in computational and theoretical principles. Therefore my projects often depart from neural recordings or connectivity datasets and, together with experimental colleagues, I aim at extracting principles of neural dynamics or geometry.


Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Washington working under the supervision of Eric Shea-Brown. I also work in the Mazzucato lab at University of Oregon. Together with the broader community we are fostering new methods and theoretical understanding of neural mechanisms involved in shaping neural representations across the brain.
