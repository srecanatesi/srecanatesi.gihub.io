I am a theoretical neuroscientist and machine learning researcher interested in the interactions and comonalities of biologial and artificial neural computations. My research group works at the intersection of AI and Neuroscience, developing tools to better understand neural network as well as algorithms for brain-machine interfaces. My work is motivated by the remarkable ability of neural networks (biological and artificial) to learn and support complex, emergent computations. I use tools from dynamical systems, information theory, statistics and machine learning to adress a range of problems, in collaboration with experimental neuroscientists and machine intelligence researchers.


Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Washington working under the supervision of Eric Shea-Brown. I also work in the Mazzucato lab at University of Oregon. Together with the broader community we are fostering new methods and theoretical understanding of neural mechanisms involved in shaping neural representations across the brain -- vision to action.
