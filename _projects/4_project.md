Strong coupling and local control of dimensionality across brain areas 
============

This work develops mean-field theoretic techniques to shed light on important properties of both electrophysiology and synaptic physiology connectivity data. One of its most prominent contribution is to establish a link between neural activity and connectivity data. It shows that neural activity in the balanced state is likely to operate in a strongly coupled regime where it is constrained on a lower dimensional manifold. Furthermore it shows how in such regime global properties of neural representations (such as their dimensionality) can be controlled by the underlying connectivity structure. The work achieves this by showing the relevance of local recurrent connections in neural circuits across the brain.
