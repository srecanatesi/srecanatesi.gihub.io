title: Metastable attractors explain the variable timing of stable behavioral action sequences
description: Neural data analysis of M2 recordings

Project quick description
============

This work analyzed data collected in a task where animals performed a consistent sequence of self-initiated actions across trials \cite{murakami2014neural} showing how the timing of such actions was linked to specific neural correlates of neural activity in secondary motor cortex (M2). Specifically we linked temporal variability in action timing to neural variability in the underlying population coding of M2. By means of a novel neural attractor model of sequences (representing the sequence of actions undertaken by the animal) and the deployment of machine learning tools (Hidden Markov Model) we were able to establish a dictionary between patterns of a ativity in the neural population and behavioral states of the animal.
