Predictive learning as a network mechanism for extracting low-dimensional latent space representations
=============

In this work we used machine learning techniques (trained recurrent neural networks) to show that predictive coding of sensory stimuli may function as a mechanism to extract the latent variables underlying the stimuli themselves. This is an important finding as it shows, for example, how in navigation experiments the latent space (locations in the environment) can be extracted by means of processing the stream of sensory input (visual scene data). It amounts to say that representations such as place-cells (representations of the latent space -- the environment) may be generated by mechanisms such as predictive coding that enable the extraction of the low-dimensional structure underlying sensory inputs (for example visual information). This work thus ascribe to prediction mechanisms the general ability to build semantic maps by the means of processing input information, an hypothesis already advanced by many others and most prominently by Tolman and Eichenbaum.
